- js improvements:

http://drupal.stackexchange.com/questions/50216/how-to-trigger-a-form-and-pass-variables-to-form-state-with-jquery/53063#53063

- rewrite the way we do BuildAndExecuteQuery.
  $query = new IslandoraSolrQueryProcessor();
  $query->solrLimit = $limit;
  $query->solrStart = $start;
  $query->solrQuery = restore_slashes($query); // do restore slashes internally
  $query->solrParams = $params; // split this out.
  $query->executeQuery();

- based on Solr version, use edismax by default for simple search.
- create import/export functionality

- bug when reordering field and then clicking configure
- but when changing solr url and then using the autocomplete.
- throw warning if adding a sort field isn't sortable

- some bugs in modal dialog resizing (facets)
- clean up table headers
- create doxygen code + wrapper doxygen
- clean up code (run through coder)

- when populating fields, if a solr field has a label in another field, maybe the default label can be the one already filled out? If the current one is empty still?
- pressing 'enter' on 'add field' results in errors and no js callback

- make labels translatable: http://drupal.org/node/1114010

- we could save us some code by storing the primary display settings in a DB table
- add luke check for date fields (breaks if not)
- more user friendly controls + advanced option
- don't prepopulate advanced search field if dropdown does not equal the solr field in url

- port from D6 to D7:
-- limit search results (block)
-- look for details (permissions, string handling, css, etc..)
-- rss feed + config

- update README.txt

Normal Priority
---------------

- rename 'solr_field_settings' to 'settings'
- clean up IslandoraSolrResults.
- use libraries module for flot
- Facet settings: add checkbox to display facet as a separate block. Can be nice for sliders to display in the content top or bottom.
- improve settings display. add little icon with settings in tooltip? misc/message-16-help.png
- add ability to add permission callback or permission id to solr display profiles
- add a check to see if the context is the search results page. Currently we
check if IslandoraSolrQueryProcessor::display is set, which is not ideal.
- update hook_help functions
- add a parameter to the luke function to return a single document.
- check if spaces could be replaced by + or %20 , which would simplify some functions (splitting strings)
http://archive.apache.org/dist/lucene/solr/ref-guide/
- don't hardcode php solr library, instead override it.
- add ajax_command_changed() to the vertical tabs to show something has changed.
- add watchdog messages on error.
- some snippets of markup could go in theme functions

Low Priority
------------

- tabledrag should update the table with ajax.
- hook_alter instead of module invoke all for object manipulation
- provide integration with display suite
- Boolean operators as query seem to choke

- when changing primary display, keep &limit in the url or should it show the default? Displays can override this though.
