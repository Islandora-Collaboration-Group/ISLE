## What is ISLE?
[ISLE](https://github.com/Islandora-Collaboration-Group/ISLE) is a community project—initially funded by [17 academic institutions](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ycx5ATbeWpUWvpZ6bwXws490CMgi0dyB9SBfPYUDEjk/edit?usp=sharing) and Born-Digital—that addresses two of the most significant pain-points in Islandora: installation and maintenance.

Looking ahead: ISLE is collaborating with the community’s [LASIR](https://github.com/Islandora-Collaboration-Group/LASIR) project to develop and include a robust suite of Institutional Repository (IR) features within Islandora. ISLE’s common, updatable platform will be advantageous to the community as we prepare to move toward the next major version of Islandora CLAW.

## Why Use ISLE?
ISLE cuts in half (compared to pre-ISLE upkeep costs) the time required to install and maintain an Islandora stack. Clear documentation makes it a snap to test installation on a laptop, install it directly on a local host server or cloud service, or update a pre-existing ISLE site. ISLE standardizes best-practice security features and protocols, removing much of the opportunity for human error from configuration and upkeep of Production Islandora systems. Multiple stacks (production, staging, and development) may be installed on a single virtual server, and each may be distinctly configured. Initial use cases are showing ISLE to be dramatically faster (more on that soon).

Islandora is a powerful digital repository comprised of over 80 different, best-of-breed open-source software libraries. Islandora’s strength is that it integrates these packages into one easy to manage system. However, this ecosystem has traditionally been complex enough as to require staff with technical expertise to install and maintain.

ISLE lowers the barrier to entry for new institutions or organizations because it reduces the complexity and expense to the point where non-technical staff can upgrade an Islandora stack in just under an hour per month. This in turn allows institutions to reallocate funds towards development or ingestion instead of maintenance. An ISLE maintained Islandora stack is secure and can be run as a production server straight out of the box.

A note about migration: ISLE contains complete documentation for migrating existing Islandora installations to the ISLE framework. Institutions currently using CONTENTdm, Digital Commons, or other platforms are able to migrate to ISLE by using the well-documented [Move to Islandora Kit](https://github.com/MarcusBarnes/mik) (MIK). It is assumed that some institutions will have custom theming, customizations and metadata formats that, while they are preserved during ISLE updates, will need to be manually refactored during the migration to CLAW.

## Funding
- **ISLE Phase I:** $90,000 crowdfunded ($66,000 from 17 academic institutions; $24,000 in-kind labor from Born-Digital); exceeded original goal of $84,000.
- **ISLE Phase II:** Williams College, in partnership with the Islandora Collaboration Group (ICG) and in consultation with the Islandora Foundation, has received a [$153,000 grant from The Andrew W. Mellon Foundation](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1iN6-EH3PyhjFUms3SgNxRRXwbaK_780G9_O1rHAcaV4/view) to support the *Islandora for All* project: “Islandora for All: Extending the Open-Source Platform to Include Broad Scale Institutional Repository Appeal and High-Performance Scalability”
- **ISLE Phase III:** TBD

## Project Sustainability
The ISLE Steering Committee (ISC) oversees the ISLE project and the ISLE Project Maintainers maintain the project with scheduled new releases on [GitHub project boards](https://github.com/Islandora-Collaboration-Group/ISLE/projects), and issue [release notes](https://islandora-collaboration-group.github.io/ISLE-Documentation/09_release_notes/release_notes/). The ISC will submit the resultant development via Islandora’s Licensed Software Acceptance Procedure ([LSAP](https://islandora.ca/developers/lsap)). The development will then become a core part of the Islandora 7x Release (Fall 2019) and will be supported and maintained by the Islandora community as part of the free and publicly shared open-source platform. Through this LSAP method, Islandora has already adopted a large number of externally contributed modules that are sustainably maintained by community members.
