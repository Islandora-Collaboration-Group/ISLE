# ISLandora Enterprise (ISLE)

| WARNING |
| :-------------      |
| The ISLE Legacy project (also known as ISLE7) is no longer actively supported by the Islandora community, except for some security updates. When creating new sites, please see the currently supported installation options found in the official Islandora community [documentation site](https://islandora.github.io/documentation/).|

ISLE is a community developed open-source project that bundles the [Islandora](https://islandora.ca) stack into a set of [Docker](https://docker.com) images that are easy to install and update. ISLE allows for persistent customizations and provides a fully functioning Islandora platform for production, staging, and development digital repositories.

## How to Install ISLE

This documentation provides clear instructions on how to install and update ISLE:

* [ISLE Installation](install/host-hardware-requirements.md):
Follow these successive steps to create a complete workflow by installing ISLE on a Local personal computer, and then on Staging and Production environments. This workflow creates a production ready Islandora site and a workflow that supports  updates, customization, and development. Additionally, you may choose to build this workflow for a New Islandora site or use this to Migrate your existing Islandora 7.x site.

* [Update ISLE](update/update.md): Update your version of ISLE to the latest release and receive improvements and security updates.

* ([Demo ISLE Installation](install/host-hardware-requirements.md): Quickly learn how to use Docker to create a new Islandora platform on your personal computer. Use this to "kick the tires" on ISLE.)
