# Optional ISLE components

This documentation area provides instructions on how to use the following optional ISLE components. 

Please note all ISLE components are built to be modular and thus can be installed independently or can work together.

* [Blazegraph](blazegraph.md): High-perfomance replacement triplestore for larger Fedora repositories

* [Varnish](varnish.md): HTTP accelerator and caching designed for content-heavy dynamic web sites 

* [TICK stack](tickstack.md): A suite of open-source applications that are used together for the storing, visualization and monitoring of data (time series metrics) gathered from running systems.
