# Utilizing and Extending ISLE’s Test Suite

## What is this component?

* Early in the history of ISLE, we did all build tests manually. We even developed a checklist spreadsheet for it: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1L-wrivXq2pUz7vcGsMCx3X7yKf27uokoaR8SovU_BsU/edit#gid=0
  * The test coverage section of this document identifies (by Spreadsheet id number) where in the test suite we have addressed the testing requirement.
  * The tests themselves are currently in a temporary location: https://github.com/Born-Digital-US/isle-ingest-samples/tree/master/behat
* ISLE Phase 2 included budget to automate this test suite, and to make it easy to trigger for various ISLE use cases on every build, as well as for use by implementing institutions to check the integrity of their ISLE builds.
* We chose to use Behat to do behavioral testing as it is the most similar to an end-user, and ultimately we want to make sure that ISLE delivers a good end-user experience. Running Unit tests was deemed insufficient, as it only tests programmatic aspects, not whether the Drupal UI allows utilization of Islandora's features.
* We chose to use Selenium and Chrome as Docker sidecars for actually executing the tests.

## Running ISLE Tests

* The most straightforward example of use is ISLE's testing environment: https://github.com/Islandora-Collaboration-Group/ISLE/blob/master/docker-compose.test.yml as configured by the CircleCI configuration: https://github.com/Islandora-Collaboration-Group/ISLE/blob/master/.circleci/config.yml
* This use case is abstracted and summarized below:

### Installation Instructions:

* Docker-compose.yml additions: several new services, for running Chrome/Selenium
```bash
chrome:
  image: selenium/node-chrome:3.141.59-neon # latest
  container_name: isle-chrome-${CONTAINER_SHORT_ID}
  environment:
    - HUB_PORT=4444
    - HUB_HOST=hub    
  networks:
    - isle-internal    
  depends_on:
    - apache
    - hub
  volumes:
    - /dev/shm:/dev/shm
    - ./data/apache/html:/var/www/html:ro

hub:
  image: selenium/hub:3.141.59-neon # latest
  container_name: isle-hub-${CONTAINER_SHORT_ID}
  networks:
    - isle-internal
  ports:
    - "4444:4444"
```
* Notes:
  * To allow uploads in tests, we must mount in the Apache file root into the "chrome" container.
  * `/dev/shm` must be shared by all testing services or they will run out of RAM and crash
  * Newer `selenium` images may be available, but are untested. YMMV.
* No changes to `.env` file(s) are necessary, although for the examples shown here we have:
  * `COMPOSE_PROJECT_NAME=isle_test`
  * `BASE_DOMAIN=isle.localdomain`
  * `CONTAINER_SHORT_ID=td`
  * `COMPOSE_FILE-COMPOSE-FILE=test.env`
  * If your use case uses other values for these variables, you may need to find/replace in the instructions below (e.g. `isle-apache-td` corresponds with the CONTAINER_SHORT_ID above)
* The full series of commands to install a clean new ISLE with a clean new Islandora Drupal, then add extra modules to support our test cases, and then execute the tests are as follows.
  * Get a good ISLE base for this test run:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Islandora-Collaboration-Group/ISLE.git
```
  * Then edit the `.env` file to contain the test suite config:
```bash
COMPOSE_PROJECT_NAME=isle_test
BASE_DOMAIN=isle.localdomain
CONTAINER_SHORT_ID=td
COMPOSE_FILE-COMPOSE-FILE=test.env
```
  * Then fire everything back up
```bash
docker-compose pull
docker-compose up -d

sleep 40
```
  * Now install Islandora from scratch, and init your Fedora repository using the tools provided by ISLE:
```bash
set -x && docker exec -it isle-apache-td bash /utility-scripts/isle_drupal_build_tools/isle_islandora_installer.sh
```
  * Now install bulk-ingest dependencies (some not required for our tests) and extra modules required by test coverage:
```bash
docker exec -it isle-apache-td bash -c "cd /var/www/html/sites/all/modules/islandora && git clone https://github.com/Islandora-Labs/islandora_solution_pack_oralhistories.git"
docker exec -it isle-apache-td bash -c "cd /var/www/html && drush -y -u 1 en islandora_oralhistories"
docker exec -it isle-apache-td bash -c "cd /var/www/html && drush dis overlay -y"
docker exec -it isle-apache-td bash -c "cd /var/www/html && drush -y -u 1 en islandora_batch"
docker exec -it isle-apache-td bash -c "cd /var/www/html/sites/all/modules/islandora && git clone https://github.com/mjordan/islandora_batch_with_derivs.git"
docker exec -it isle-apache-td bash -c "cd /var/www/html && drush -y -u 1 en islandora_batch_with_derivs"
docker exec -it isle-apache-td bash -c "cd /var/www/html && drush -y -u 1 en islandora_book_batch"
docker exec -it isle-apache-td bash -c "cd /var/www/html && drush -y -u 1 en islandora_newspaper_batch"
docker exec -it isle-apache-td bash -c "cd /var/www/html/sites/all/modules/islandora && git clone https://github.com/MarcusBarnes/islandora_compound_batch.git"
docker exec -it isle-apache-td bash -c "cd /var/www/html && drush -y -u 1 en islandora_compound_batch"
```
  * Make sure your `/etc/hosts` has an entry for the domain you'll be using (`isle.localdomain` in this example)
  * Now clone the repository with the tests, put it where Drupal expects it (`sites/all/behat`), and install Behat dependencies with Composer:
```bash
git clone git@github.com:Born-Digital-US/isle-behat.git data/isle-behat
docker cp data/isle-behat isle-apache-td:/var/www/html/sites/behat
docker exec -it isle-apache-td bash -c "chown -R islandora:www-data /var/www/html/sites/behat/"
docker exec -it isle-apache-td bash -c "cd /var/www/html/sites/behat && composer install "
docker exec -it isle-apache-td bash -c "chmod 700 /var/www/html/sites/behat/run-isle-tests.sh"
sudo chmod -R 777 ~/isle/data/apache/html/sites/behat/debug
```
   * And now we're ready to run tests:
```bash
docker exec -it isle-apache-td bash -c "cd /var/www/html/sites/behat && ./run-isle-tests.sh --run=services"
docker exec -it isle-apache-td bash -c "cd /var/www/html/sites/behat && ./run-isle-tests.sh --run=apache"
```

## Additional Notes
* If you have your own ISLE already, just omit that initial `git clone` for ISLE. If you use the script, we're assuming you've cloned our whole repository, switched to the `travis` branch, and are running it from there.
* Modifications to tests may be necessary based on your institutional theme and configuration.

---

## Automated test triggers

* CircleCI runs these tests every time an update is pushed to the main ISLE repo. Sometimes things fail because the wind was blowing the wrong way, so we run it again and it will pass.

## Troubleshooting

* Come discuss on the ISLE Interest Group email list and/or bi-weekly meetings.
