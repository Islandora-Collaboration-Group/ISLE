# TICK Stack: Dashboard Visualization for Systems Metrics and Logging Events

## Use Cases & User Stories

* As a repository administrator, I expect to be able to view real-time and some historic systems/performance metrics without digging around in server logs.
* As a repository administrator, I should be able to use the dashboard to troubleshoot the repository (_like when it's hanging or objects are slow to load_)

* As a repository owner/manager, I expect logging to be handled in a way that does not endanger my systems health and performance over time.

* As a repository owner/manager, I expect to be able to set logging levels for all relevant log streams.

* As a repository administrator, I expect to be able to view in a web dashboard:
    * Real-time and recent historic systems/performance metrics
    * Real-time and recent historic system and application logs

* As a repository administrator, I expect to be able to use monitoring tools that do not burden the target server thus I can setup monitoring tools remotely and pull data from the ISLE server for review.

## New Functionality

The "TICK" stack is a suite of open-source applications that are used together for the storing, visualization and monitoring of data (time series metrics) gathered from running systems. The TICK stack was created and is developed by [Influxdata](https://www.influxdata.com) which is _"...dedicated to open source and truly cares about helping developers get to results faster with less complexity and less code."_

The TICK stack is used with ISLE to:

* Monitor running systems in Development, Staging or Production
    * Do note that users can monitor **ANY** system or systems with these tools, not just ISLE-related platforms.

* Create alerts that can be sent to email, text or Slack™ to warn users, system-administrators of potential issues, storage or memory challenges and much more.

* As a one-stop "search-engine" of log and metric data for all ISLE containers, services and applications, host servers, etc.

* Help ISLE users to better understand how their systems work, how Islandora works and to greatly improve visibility on applications, services and processes within ISLE

The use and setup of TICK within the ISLE platform is as an optional [sidecar](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/architecture/patterns/sidecar) to ISLE. There are various ways one can setup TICK in general as a software, as services on the ISLE Host server or to be run as Docker containers.

* TICK is comprised of the following main services and software:

    * [**T**elegraf](https://www.influxdata.com/time-series-platform/telegraf/) - a plugin-driven server agent for collecting and sending metrics and events from databases, systems, and IoT sensors.

    * [**I**nfluxdb](https://www.influxdata.com/time-series-platform/) - the open source time series database   is designed to handle high write and query loads and provides a SQL-like query language called InfluxQL   for interacting with data.
    
    * [**C**hronograf](https://www.influxdata.com/time-series-platform/chronograf/) - the user interface and   administrative component for using templates and libraries to rapidly build dashboards with real-time   visualizations.
    
    * [**K**apacitor](https://www.influxdata.com/time-series-platform/kapacitor/) - the native data processing engine which can process both stream and batch data from InfluxDB, acting on this data in real-time via its programming language TICKscript.

---

## System Requirements

* [ISLE](https://github.com/Islandora-Collaboration-Group/ISLE) release version `1.4.0`
    * `git clone https://github.com/Islandora-Collaboration-Group/ISLE.git`

### ISLE Images

* Following the installation steps below, an end user will configure  / edit their ISLE running system(s) to ultimately use the following images and tags from Docker-Hub:


| Service | Repository | Tag |
| ---     | ---        | --- | 
| Apache | [islandoracollabgroup/isle-apache](https://cloud.docker.com/u/islandoracollabgroup/repository/docker/islandoracollabgroup/isle-apache/tags) | `1.4.0`|
| Fedora | [islandoracollabgroup/isle-fedora](https://cloud.docker.com/u/islandoracollabgroup/repository/docker/islandoracollabgroup/isle-fedora/tags) | `1.4.0`|
| Image-services | [islandoracollabgroup/isle-imageservices](https://cloud.docker.com/u/islandoracollabgroup/repository/docker/islandoracollabgroup/isle-imageservices) | `1.4.0` |
| MySQL | [islandoracollabgroup/isle-mysql](https://cloud.docker.com/u/islandoracollabgroup/repository/docker/islandoracollabgroup/isle-mysql) | `1.4.0` |
| Portainer | [portainer/portainer](https://hub.docker.com/r/portainer/portainer) | `latest` |
| Solr  | [islandoracollabgroup/isle-solr](https://cloud.docker.com/u/islandoracollabgroup/repository/docker/islandoracollabgroup/isle-solr/tags) | `1.4.0` |
| Traefik | [traefik/traefik](https://hub.docker.com/_/traefik) | `1.7.9` |

* Additional systems overhead, including:

* For any system that is running the full TICK stack as a side car
    * Recommend an additional 2-3 GB of RAM
    * Recommend an additional 5-10 GB of storage disk space

* For any system that is running the Telegraf agent only
    * Recommend an additional 512MB to 1 GB of RAM

* Use the `docker-compose-tick.yml` file for setup and/or modification. This file will have not only the correct setup with the TICK stack but the necessary `syslog` driver code and tagging.

* Use the `latest` tags for the TICK base images
    * `image: telegraf:latest`
    * `image: influxdb:latest`
    * `image: chronograf:latest`
    * `image: kapacitor:latest`

* [Rsyslog](https://www.rsyslog.com/) has to be installed on any ISLE Host server that is to be monitored whether that system is running fullstack TICK or simply the Telegraf agent.

    * Rsyslog is used to help the Telegraf agent forward log messages from Docker, the running ISLE containers and the host system to Influxdb.

    * Use the default Ansible script in the ISLE repository that can install `rsyslog` on any host server.

    * Manual options
        * [Red Hat / CentOS](https://www.rsyslog.com/rhelcentos-rpms/)
        * [Ubuntu / Debian](https://www.rsyslog.com/ubuntu-repository/)

* (_Optional_) Use some of the "canned" `.tick` (_tickscript_) templates to create dashboards and alerts provided in the `./config/tick/chronograf/tickscripts` directory. See the section Templates for more detail. (TO DO)

---

### Telegraf Agent Reporting Plugins

The Telegraf agent used for ISLE has a default configuration which runs the following plugins to monitor various services whether it is on a Production or Staging system.

There are three `.conf` files found within `./config/tick/telegraf`

* `telegraf.conf` - Use this as a generic configuration for any system you'd like to monitor. Use this template file as a method to monitor ISLE environments that are not Staging or Production
* `telegraf.staging.conf` - Edit this file to run a full TICK stack on your ISLE Staging server which can monitor both your Staging and Production systems. 
* `telegraf.production.conf` - Edit this file to point to your full TICK stack running on your ISLE Staging server.

To review or configure plugins, edit the appropriate `telegraf.conf` file for your environment and navigate to the `INPUT PLUGINS` section.

If an ISLE User would like to add a plugin to monitor additional services, please review the additional information below on Telegraf plugins which can be found in two places:

* Telegraf Plugins Documentation https://docs.influxdata.com/telegraf/v1.10/plugins/inputs/

## Adoption Process Overview

The installation instructions below will walk you through how to run the full TICK stack on a Staging ISLE host system but only run  a Telegraf container (agent) on the Production system. This will be referred to from now on as the "sidecar" setup.

The data from both systems will be collected, analyzed and accessed on / from the the Staging host system via a dashboard called Chronograf. You can also setup alerts from this dashboard too.

* You'll start by backing up all important data as needed.

* You'll stop any running containers

* You'll download new ISLE images tagged as `1.4.0`


* You'll copy over a new configuration file for a service called `rsyslog`. 
    * This will allow TICK to get information from the ISLE Host server `syslog` logger.
    * You may also need to ensure that the `rsyslog` service and software is installed on your ISLE Host Server as well.

* You'll copy over a new Docker `daemon.json` file to get Docker the right log driver; which will change from `json` to `syslog`.

* You'll make additional edits and modifications to the following ISLE configuration files:
    * `docker-compose.staging.yml`
    * `docker-compose.production.yml`  
    * `staging.env`
    * `production.env`  

* You'll edit the Staging Telegraf Agent's empty or default settings to properly monitor the various local ISLE services and send metrics to the local Influxdb database on the Staging system.

* You'll restart your containers with the new services having been added and configured.

* Using a web browser, you'll navigate to the new Chronograf dashboard on the Staging server and complete the configuration of the Influxdb, Chronograf and Kapacitor services.
    * You'll have the option to create new dashboards
    * If desired, you'll add additional alerts

* You'll repeat the steps to edit the Telegraf Agent's configuration for your Production system only. You do not need to install the remaining "ICK" stack on Production though.

* You can then review the `Using Chronograf` section to learn how to review the new added hosts, dashboards and Log Viewer to review ISLE services log streams.

* Lastly and optionally, you can setup alerts in Chronograf to warn you and your team of when certain events or issues have occurred on your newly monitored systems.

---

## Installation

### Assumptions

* Previously installed and running Production and Staging ISLE Host systems are in place already

* You'll need to use the ISLE images tagged as `1.4.0` and higher for the syslog driver changes to be in place.

* That the "sidecar" method will be the installation type running on the Staging system to receive data from Staging and Production.

* A firewall configuration that allows incoming public traffic to port `8086` traffic

* A firewall configuration that allows incoming private traffic access to port `8888`. It is recommended that this not be general public access but whitelisted to a select range of IP addresses given this will be the `Chronograf` dashboard port. Trusted users only please.

* Only installation on Linux based host systems e.g. Debian / Ubuntu 18.04+ and Red Hat / CentOS 7.x+
    * Attempting to run TICK locally on a MacOS system can fail https://github.com/docker/for-mac/issues/3303

* Other TICK / ISLE configurations are possible but **are not supported or detailed** as of yet in this documentation. End users seeking alternative setup possibilities are encouraged to further review and mine from the official Influxdata [documentation](https://docs.influxdata.com/platform/introduction/).

---

### Installation Instructions

* Shut down all running ISLE containers, Staging first, then production second once Staging is up and running again.

---

#### 01. Docker syslog Driver Setup

* You will need to use the `sudo` command or become the `root` user for the steps below. Copying this file allows the Docker Daemon to use the `syslog` driver for log files and reporting to the `telegraf` agent.

* Check if you already have an existing `/etc/docker/daemon.json` file. 
    * If **YES**, add / merge  the contents of `./config/tick/docker/daemon.json` with your current `/etc/docker/daemon.json` file.
    * If **NO**, copy `./config/tick/docker/daemon.json` to `/etc/docker/`
        * **Example:** `sudo cp ./config/tick/docker/daemon.json /etc/docker/`

* Restart the Docker service
    * `sudo service docker restart` or `sudo systemctl restart docker`
    * You can check if the service is running with `sudo service docker status`

---

#### 02. Rsyslog Setup

* You will need to use the `sudo` command or become the `root` user for the steps below. Copying this file allows the information from the host `syslog` be forwarded to the `telegraf` agent.

* Copy the Telegraf configuration file to the Rsyslog.d directory so Rsyslog will forward logs to the Telegraf agent with correct formatting. Assumes you are in the ISLE project root directory.
  
    * `sudo cp ./config/tick/rsyslog/50-telegraf.conf /etc/rsyslog.d/`

* Please note on `Ubuntu` systems, you will need to also reset the `/var/spool/rsyslog` permissions due to a bug. This has not been observed behavior on `CentOS` Host servers _yet_.
  
  * Reset permissions process:
      * `sudo chown -Rv syslog:adm /var/spool/rsyslog`
  
  * Restart the `rsyslog` service 
      * `sudo service rsyslog restart` or `sudo systemctl restart rsyslog`
  
  * You can check if the service is running
      * `sudo service rsyslog status`

**Example output:**

```bash

#### 03. Edit File: docker-compose.staging.yml

* Edit the `docker-compose.staging.yml` file and uncomment lines to enable the new `TICK` services. There is a section called `# Start - TICK stack services section`, underneath that is all of the `TICK` code to be uncommented. (_remove the # before and ensure all code aligns properly like the services above it._)

* At the end of every service definition (_mysql, fedora, solr etc_) within the `docker-compose.staging.yml`, uncomment the following:

```bash
#    logging:
#      driver: syslog
#      options:
#        tag: "{{.Name}}"
```

Uncommented example:

```bash
  mysql:
    image: islandoracollabgroup/isle-mysql:1.4.0
    container_name: isle-mysql-${CONTAINER_SHORT_ID}
    networks:
      - isle-internal
    ports:
      - "3306:3306"      
    volumes:
      - isle-db-data:/var/lib/mysql
      - isle-mysql-log:/var/log/mysql
    logging:
      driver: syslog
      options:
        tag: "{{.Name}}"
```

* Uncomment the lines below for the TICK stack data volumes to the end of the `volumes` section of the `docker-compose.staging.yml` file.

Uncommented TICK volumes example:

```bash
volumes:
  isle-db-data:
  isle-solr-data:
  isle-portainer-data:
  isle-fedora-resourceIndex:
  isle-fedora-activemq:
  isle-fedora-XACML:
  isle-influxdb-data:
  isle-kapacitor-data:
  isle-chronograf-data:
```

#### 04. Telegraf Agent Configuration on Staging

**Note:** These instructions are for configuring the Telegraf Agent that runs on the same system as the "ICK" stack i.e. Influxdb, Chronograf and Kapacitor do, typically your ISLE Staging system.

The instructions to setup only the Telegraf Agent on an ISLE system e.g. your Production system are found below in the section called `06. Telegraf Agent (Agent only) installation on Production`.


* You'll need to edit the `./config/tick/telegraf/telegraf.staging.conf` to add the following:
    * `hostname = ""`
        * Enter the name of the server you will be monitoring e.g. `isle-server-staging` or `icg-staging` etc. This value can be a [FQDN](https://kb.iu.edu/d/aiuv), an IP or any name really.
    * `database = "telegraf"`
        * By default, the ISLE TICK setup assumes this database as it is the easiest but pools all data received by individual monitored hosts into one database. For first time users, recommend leaving this value in place.
        * Users are free to change this to any value to segregate data by systems, group etc.
    * Change `servers = ["root:<ISLE_ROOT_PASSWORD_HERE>@tcp(mysql:3306)/?tls=false"]` to use your Staging MySQL Root password. Typically this value is in your `staging.env` file. Swap out the `<ISLE_ROOT_PASSWORD_HERE>` with your Staging MySQL Root password.


* Start up the ISLE Docker containers again. `docker-compose up -d`

* Depending on your internet connection, this startup process may take a few minutes, as the new TICK images are being downloaded and started.

* As a precaution, restart the `rsyslog` service once the ISLE Docker containers have reported that they have started up without issue.
    * `sudo service rsyslog restart` or `sudo systemctl restart rsyslog`
  
* You can check if the service is running:
    * `sudo service rsyslog status`
    * Note the any previous errors have stopped.

```bash

sudo service rsyslog status

#### 06. Telegraf Agent (Agent Only) Installation on Production

#### Adoption Process Overview

* Use these instructions to add an additional Docker Telegraf container on a Production system. Once you've followed the instructions below, a new Production host will appear in your Chronograf dashboard for you to review alongside your previously configured Staging host.

#### Assumptions

* A previously installed and running ISLE Host Production system is in place already.

* You'll need to use ISLE version `1.4.0` for the syslog driver changes to be in place.

* That the "sidecar" TICK installation is already in place on the Staging server prior.

* Your firewall allows outbound port `8086` traffic

####  Installation

In the recommended setup and usage of TICK, the Staging server will be running the full stack of TICK as a collection point for all Staging data and any Production system will only need the Telegraf agent installed.

To install the Telegraf agent on a Production system:

* Shut down all running ISLE containers on the Production system

* You'll need to edit the `./config/tick/telegraf/telegraf.production.conf` to add the following:
    * `hostname = ""`
        * Enter the name of the server you will be monitoring e.g. `isle-server-prod` or `icg-production` etc. This value can be a [FQDN](https://kb.iu.edu/d/aiuv) i.e. `production-server.domain.edu`, an IP or any name really. Recommend a short name to be easily read and understood.
    * `urls = ["http://influxdb:8086"]`
        * Replace the `influxdb` value with the [FQDN](https://kb.iu.edu/d/aiuv) of the Staging server that is running the full TICK stack and that this Telegraf agent will be sending data to e.g.
      `urls = ["http://staging-server.domain.edu:8086"]`
    * `database = "telegraf"`
        * By default, the ISLE TICK setup assumes this database as it is the easiest but pools all data received by individual monitored hosts into one database. For first time users, recommend leaving this value in place.
        * Users are free to change this to any value to segregate data by systems, group etc.
    * Change `servers = ["root:<ISLE_ROOT_PASSWORD_HERE>@tcp(mysql:3306)/?tls=false"]` to use your Production MySQL Root password. Typically this value is in your `production.env` file. Swap out the `<ISLE_ROOT_PASSWORD_HERE>` with your Production MySQL Root password.


#### Edit File: docker-compose.production.yml

* Edit the `docker-compose.production.yml` file and uncomment lines to enable the new `TICK - Telegraf` agent / service. There is a section called `# Start - TICK stack services section`, underneath that is the `TICK` code to be uncommented. (_remove the # before and ensure all code aligns properly like the services above it._)

* At the end of every service definition (_mysql, fedora, solr etc_) within the `docker-compose.production.yml`, uncomment the following:

```bash
#    logging:
#      driver: syslog
#      options:
#        tag: "{{.Name}}"
```

Uncommented example:

```bash
  mysql:
    image: islandoracollabgroup/isle-mysql:1.4.0
    container_name: isle-mysql-${CONTAINER_SHORT_ID}
    networks:
      - isle-internal
    ports:
      - "3306:3306"      
    volumes:
      - isle-db-data:/var/lib/mysql
      - isle-mysql-log:/var/log/mysql
    logging:
      driver: syslog
      options:
        tag: "{{.Name}}"
```

* Copy the Telegraf configuration file to the Rsyslog.d directory so Rsyslog will forward logs to the Telegraf agent with correct formatting. Assumes you are in the ISLE project root directory.
    * **Example:** `sudo cp ./config/tick/rsyslog/50-telegraf.conf /etc/rsyslog.d/50-telegraf.conf`

* Copy over the Docker log driver configuration and then restart the Docker service.
    * **Example:** `sudo cp ./config/tick/docker/daemon.json /etc/docker/daemon.json`
    * `sudo service docker restart`

* Start up the ISLE Docker containers again. `docker-compose up -d`

* Depending on your internet connection, this startup process may take a few minutes, as the new TICK images are being downloaded and started.

* Once the Production containers are back online, the services are running e.g. you see the Drupal site, etc. navigate to the `Hosts` section within the `Chronograf` dashboard. You should now see your new Production server name. This means the Telegraf Agent on your Production ISLE system is now reporting properly. 

---

## Troubleshooting

If you are not seeing your server(s) appear in the `Hosts` section nor seeing log information flowing into the `Log Viewer` section, recommend the following:

* Check that any potential firewalls are allowing communication between the Production and Staging servers on port `8086`

* Ensure that all configuration files have been copied over:
    * The new Docker log driver configuration should be found here `/etc/docker/daemon.json`
    * The new rsyslog / Telegraf configuration should be found here: `/etc/rsyslog.d/50-telegraf.conf`

* Check that the TICK related containers are running without exit codes. 
    * `docker ps -a`
  
* Check that the new `Telegraf` docker container is running on Production

* You can check if the Telegraf agent is communicating properly with the Influxdb database and if the Influxdb database is running by using the following command in your terminal:

    * Shell into the telegraph container
        * `docker exec -it isle-telegraf-ld bash`
        * `curl -I http://influxdb:8086/ping`

The output should confirm connectivity by looking like this:

```bash

root@b2e3471b3bbb:/# curl -I http://influxdb:8086/ping

HTTP/1.1 204 No Content
Content-Type: application/json

```

* Repeat these instructions from the start if need be.

## Using Chronograf

### Adoption Process Overview

* Use these instructions below to learn how to view all monitored hosts, their services and log streams within Chronograf using dashboards and the built-in Log viewer. There are additional optional steps for setting up alerts to warn you and your team by email of when certain events happen e.g. running out of disk space, server crashes, etc.

### Viewing Host Systems

* Using a web browser, navigate to your new Chronograf dashboard e.g. http://**<replacethiswithyourdomain_here>**:8888

* To view hosts, click the `Host List` button to the left. It should appear as an eye symbol in the left navigational panel. Your host(s) should appear in the `Host List`. You can click on the name to investigate the system further.
  
* By default in the `Apps` section, the three dashboards that you just setup i.e. `system`, `docker` and `mysql` should also appear. Click on any one of them to view stats specific to that reporting plugin.

---

### Viewing Logs

* To view logs ordered by hosts, click the `Log Viewer` button to the left. It should appear as cut log symbol in the left navigational panel. Your host(s) should appear in the `Log Viewer`.
    * **Note:** This will be a lot of information at any given time especially if you connect multiple hosts.

---

### View Logs by Specific Host

Within the `Log Viewer` page:

* Scroll at the bottom of the page over to the `Host` column in the viewer and click on the name e.g. `your-hostname-here`

    * This should now filter out all other host information

    * At the top left hand corner below the search bar, the following appears `host == your-hostname-here`. This is the syntax used for searching by host e.g. `host == your-hostname-here` this is the same shorthand name used to configure the Telegraf agent.

    * Alternatively, you can now use this value `host == your-hostname-here` within the _Search logs using keywords or regular expressions_ search bar.

    * You can even single click into the `host == your-hostname-here` posted query and change the name to a different host.

* You can also search using ISLE key service words to drill down on log reporting. e.g. `apache`, `fedora`, `varnish` etc

---

### Setting up Alerts in Chronograf

#### Adoption Process Overview

The instructions below are going to:

* Setup an "alert handler" in the Chronograf dashboard for delivery of alert messages. We'll use email as the example alert handler service.

* Show you how to set up two basic alerts using your new alert handler
    * `Deadman` Alert - Alerts you when the ISLE host server is unresponsive, has crashed or is "dead."
    * `Disk Space` Alert - Alerts you when your disks are running out of space

#### Assumptions

* Ability to send emails from the ISLE host server has already been setup.
    * You may already be using an existing off host email server or service that is integrated with the ISLE Drupal site.
    * Alternatively your IT dept may provide you with an existing email server or account details as well. 
    * We recommend setting up a [SendGrid](https://sendgrid.com/) or [MailGun](https://www.mailgun.com/) account which are cloud-based email delivery platforms. While both these services have "free" tiers, both are commercial products. However, the ease of use in setting up, using and keeping your ISLE system free of additional complex email service or software installations are why they're recommended here.
    
* Additional alerts may be contributed by the ISLE maintainers and/or community over time.

---

### Chronograf Alert Handler - Email Setup

While TICK supports a wide variety of alert types and delivery mechanisms we're going to configure the basic alerts using **email**. You can opt to setup additional alert handlers e.g. Slack, hipChat, pagerDuty and more using the official [Chronograf documentation](https://docs.influxdata.com/chronograf/v1.7/guides/configuring-alert-endpoints/)

#### Assumptions

* Prior to starting, you will need to have your SMTP credentials (user name, password and location of the 3rd party email server) at the ready. This information may have been provided to you by your IT department or from when you may have used one of the recommended cloud-based email delivery platforms;  [SendGrid](https://sendgrid.com/) or [MailGun](https://www.mailgun.com/).

* Please note for Sendgrid email users **only**, you'll need to create an appropriate API Key for each ISLE host server.
  * Log into your Sendgrid account
  * Navigate to Settings > API Keys
  * Click on the `Create API Key` button
  * Set the level of API Key Permissions (_recommend Restricted Access_)
      * Set the appropriate level of permissions for each section
  * Copy the generated API Key to a password manager or secure place for documents or documentation.
    * This is the token you'll use to send email with. You'll need to use it again below.
    * For more information as needed: Sendgrid SMTP [Documentation](https://sendgrid.com/docs/API_Reference/SMTP_API/integrating_with_the_smtp_api.html)

### Chronograf Alert Handler - Email Setup steps

* When you have these credentials, click on the `Configuration` (wrench icon) button on the left hand side of the Chronograf dashboard.

* Under the `Kapacitor Connection` column
    * click into the Kapacitor settings dropdown
    * click on the pencil symbol (_Not the trashcan_)
        * If that doesn't work, try navigating to http://yourdomainhere:8888/sources/1/kapacitors/1/edit

- Within the `Configure Alert Endpoints` page, click on the `SMTP` section / button and fill in your creds. Please note, the directions below are for both conventional email and Sendgrid. Only pick **one** to follow please.
  * **For conventional email users:**
    * `SMTP Host` - change `localhost` to the correct host name
    * `SMTP Port` - change `25` to the correct port e.g. `465` (SSL) or `587` (TLS)
    * `From Email` - enter the email account you'll be using to send alerts **with**
    * `To Email` - enter the email account you'll be sending alerts **to**
    * `User` - enter the username for the email account you'll be using to send alerts **with**
    * `Password` - enter the password for the email account you'll be using to send alerts **with**
    * Click the `Configuration Enabled` checkbox
    * Click the blue `Save Changes` button
    * Click the `Send Test Alert` and confirm that a new test email has been sent to the email account you'll be receiving alerts **to /at**
      * Move onto the next step, ignoring the `Sendgrid` information below.
  * **For Sendgrid email users only:**
    * `SMTP Host` - change `localhost` to `smtp.sendgrid.net`
    * `SMTP Port` - change `25` to `587`
    * `From Email` - enter the email account you'll be using to send alerts **with**
    * `To Email` - enter the email account you'll be sending alerts **to**
    * `User` - Enter the username of `apikey`
    * `Password` - Enter the long API key generated from the above steps 
    * Click the `Configuration Enabled` checkbox
    * Click the blue `Save Changes` button
    * Click the `Send Test Alert` and confirm that a new test email has been sent to the email account you'll be receiving alerts **to /at**
      * Move onto the next step.

You can now use this delivery mechanism (alert handler) when you set up individual alerts.

---

#### Alert - Deadman (system)

The Deadman Alert handler can be used for any state, system or service. The instructions below are to setup an Alert on your monitored system to email you when the ISLE host system has been unresponsive for a period of time that you choose.

This will mean the alert can be triggered by the following events:
  * The monitored ISLE host server:
    * has crashed or is "dead".
    * has been shutdown
  * The ISLE Docker containers:
    * have been shutdown

For more details, please consult the official [Kapacitor documentation](https://docs.influxdata.com/kapacitor/v1.5/nodes/alert_node/#deadman) for this alert handler.

##### Assumptions:

* You have already setup an alert handler e.g. the Email Alert handler.

* Any testing of the alert and involved system should start with a non-production system to avoid downtime or confusion.

##### Alert - Deadman setup steps

* Within your running TICK system dashboard, click on the Alerting section and from the dropdown choose the `Manage Tasks` link.

* Click on the blue `Build Alert Rule` button on the right.

* Within the `Name` section, enter a name of your choice for your alert
  * Example: `Offline Server`

* Within the `Alert Type` section, select `Deadman`

* Within the `Time Series` section, select `telegraf.autogen` from the  `DB.RetentionPolicy` section on the left.
  * Within the `Measurements & Tags` section, scroll down to the bottom and expand `system` then `host`.
    * Please note: There may be a number associated with `host`, e.g. `host-8`, this is how many servers or systems you have reporting to this dashboard and TICK system.
    * Select some or all appropriate hosts, you may have only two (Production and Staging) or you may have more. There will be green dots filling the previously empty checkbox to indicate a selected host.
    * Once selected, click the `Group By host` button directly above this field. It should now be highlighted in blue.

* Within the `Conditions` section, select a value of time from the `Send Alert if Data is missing for` section's dropdown list.
  * **Recommendation:** Select a value between 5 and 30 minutes per your alerting needs. Typically we recommend about `5 - 10 mins`

* Within the `Alert Handlers` section, select `email` from the `Send this Alert to` section's dropdown list.
  * This should pre-populate the appropriate fields with your previously configured email alert handler.
  * You will need to add the apppropriate `Recipient E-mail Addresses` (_the email address you want these alerts to be sent to_)
  * You can opt to add additional formatting for the body of the email as needed but we'll leave this field empty for the purposes of this setup. As a result, you'll get additional JSON formated output in the body of any sent alert email which can be useful for further debugging.

* Within the `Message` section, copy and paste the following starter message below into this blank field please.
  * `{{ .ID }} - {{ index .Tags "host" }} server is {{ .Level }}.`

* Click on the green `Save Rule` button at the top right hand side of the dashboard.
  * You should get a notification on the Alert webpage that your rule was saved. It is brief, small and disappears quickly. The Alert is now saved and active.
  * You should now see `1 Alert Rule` with the name of your alert e.g `Offline Server` in blue.
  * You should now see `1 TICKscript` with the name of your alert e.g `Offline Server` in green.
  * These two entries are the same alert rule but if you wanted more granular changes, you could edit the green `TICKscript` to add more specific `flux` code.
    * These changes once saved would also reflect in the blue Alert rule as well. One is really for GUI access the other for granular code.
  * No further steps are needed other than testing your alert should you choose.

* (Optional) - Test your alert
  * It is recommended that you test your alert by either:
    * (Fast) - Shut down the ISLE Docker containers running on the monitored system.
      * Shut down your ISLE containers on the monitored system.
      * Wait for the alloted amount of time you choose above.
      * Check your email account for the Alert message with (Critical) in the email header
      * If you get your alert email, great!
        * Restart your ISLE Docker containers
      * Check your email account for the Alert message with (OK) in the email header
    * (Long) _ Shut down your ISLE Docker containers running on the monitored system and then your ISLE host server.
      * Shut down your ISLE containers on the monitored system.
      * Shutdown your monitored ISLE host server.
      * Wait for the alloted amount of time you choose above.
      * Check your email account for the Alert message with (Critical) in the email header. You'll start getting one every minute.
      * If you get your alert email, great!
        * Now restart your server
        * Now restart your Docker containers
      * Check your email account for the Alert message with (OK) in the email header
  * If the alert doesn't show up, then retrace your steps, perhaps use a lower value of time and tune as necessary.
  * Repeat as necessary on either your Production or additional system(s)

* **Please note:** If you only want one alert when your server is down, you'll need to edit your TICKScript (_the green one_) and add the following piece of code `.stateChangesOnly()` to the end of the `var trigger = data` section, ensure that it is indented and is aligned with the line above it. Then click on the green `Save Rule` button at the top right hand side of the dashboard.

##### Alert - Deadman Flux code explanation

* `{{ .ID }}` = Name of the Alert
* `{{ index .Tags "host" }}` = Name of server
* `{{ .Level }}.` = `Critical` or `OK`

This message is slightly formatted for readability and context.

By using this starter message via email effectively you'll get two alerts for the following conditions:

* When the system (server) is "down" or unreachable for the duration of time you selected, you'll get an alert email every minute.
  * For example, the system name is `acme-prod`: `Offline Server-host=acme-server - acme-prod server is CRITICAL.`
  * There may be additional information put in the email body for review. It will be formatted in JSON notation.
  * If you only want one alert, you'll need to edit your TICKScript (_the green one_) and add the following piece of code `.stateChangesOnly()` to the end of the `var trigger = data` section, ensure that it is indented and is aligned with the line above it. Then click on the green `Save Rule` button at the top right hand side of the dashboard.

* Once you've taken manual steps on the affected server to restore connectivity and the ISLE system, its containers and services are effectively backup and running, you'll get a follow-up email that indicates that the server is back up and running.
  * For example: `Offline Server-host=acme-prod - acme-prod server is OK`
  * There may be additional information put in the email body for review. It will be formatted in JSON notation.

Please note: The code suggestions above use Influxdata `Flux` syntax, for more information on how to change messages and their values please use the official [Flux syntax basics documentation](https://docs.influxdata.com/flux/v0.36/introduction/getting-started/syntax-basics/) for more information.

#### Alert - Disk Space

The Disk Space Alert handler can be used to alert you when one or more of your disk(s) are potentially running out of space.

The instructions below are to setup an Alert on your monitored ISLE host system to email you when the ISLE host system operating system disk has passed a threshold of `75%` disk used (full) capacity. You are welcome to change this threshold to a lower or higher value as needed to give yourself or your IT staff time to anticipate the potential disk growth prior to system challenges or errors.

This will mean the alert can be triggered by the following events:
  * An increase in disk usage by the ISLE host system operating system disk that surpasses `75%` usage

##### Assumptions:
 * You have already setup an alert handler e.g. the Email Alert handler.
 * Any testing of the alert and involved system should start with a non-production system to avoid downtime or confusion.

##### Alert - Disk Space setup steps

* Within your running TICK system dashboard, click on the Alerting section and from the dropdown choose the `Manage Tasks` link.

* Click on the blue `Build Alert Rule` button on the right.

* Within the `Name` section, enter a name of your choice for your alert
  * Example: `Disk Space Exceeded`

* Within the `Alert Type` section, select `Threshold`

* Within the `Time Series` section, select `telegraf.autogen` from the  `DB.RetentionPolicy` section on the left.
  * Within the `Measurements & Tags` section, scroll down to the bottom and expand `disk` then `host`.
    * Please note: There may be a number associated with `host`, e.g. `host-8`, this is how many servers or systems you have reporting to this dashboard and TICK system.
    * Select some or all appropriate hosts, you may have only two (Production and Staging) or you may have more. There will be green dots filling the previously empty checkbox to indicate a selected host.
    * Once selected, click the `Group By host` button directly above this field. It should now be highlighted in blue.
    * Within the `Fields` section, select `used_percent`
      * There will be green dots filling the previously empty checkbox to indicate a selected field.

* Within the `Conditions` section:
  * Select the `greater than` value in the `Send Alert where` section dropdown box. This value may be pre-populated by default.
  * Enter the percent value of `90` in the empty `Send Alert where used_percent is greater than ` section's dropdown list.
    * **Recommendation:** You can change this value as need but a numeric value between `75` and `90` is recommended.

* Within the `Alert Handlers` section, select `email` from the `Send this Alert to` section's dropdown list.
  * This should pre-populate the appropriate fields with your previously configured email alert handler.
  * You will need to add the apppropriate `Recipient E-mail Addresses` (_the email address you want these alerts to be sent to_)
  * You can opt to add additional formatting for the body of the email as needed but we'll leave this field empty for the purposes of this setup. As a result, you'll get additional JSON formated output in the body of any sent alert email which can be useful for further debugging.

* Within the `Message` section, copy and paste the following starter message below into this blank field please.
  * `{{.ID }} - {{ index .Tags "host"}} {{ .Name }} usage is at {{ index .Fields "value" | printf "%0.2f" }}% - {{ .Level }}`

* Click on the green `Save Rule` button at the top right hand side of the dashboard.
  * You should get a notification on the Alert webpage that your rule was saved. It is brief, small and disappears quickly. The Alert is now saved and active.
  * You should now see `1 Alert Rule` with the name of your alert e.g `Disk Space Exceeded` in blue.
  * You should now see `1 TICKscript` with the name of your alert e.g `Disk Space Exceeded` in green.
  * These two entries are the same alert rule but if you wanted more granular changes, you could edit the green `TICKscript` to add more specific `flux` code.
    * These changes once saved would also reflect in the blue Alert rule as well. One is really for GUI access the other for granular code.
  * No further steps are needed other than testing your alert should you choose.

* (Optional) - Test your alert
  * First, check the current disk usage on your monitored ISLE host system by sshing into the system and running `df -h`, the output should look something like:

**Example:**  Your output below may not match exactly.
```bash
df -h

Filesystem      Size  Used Avail Use% Mounted on
udev            1.9G     0  1.9G   0% /dev
tmpfs           389M  1.4M  388M   1% /run
/dev/nvme0n1p1   18G   68G   50G  26% /
tmpfs           1.9G     0  1.9G   0% /dev/shm
tmpfs           5.0M     0  5.0M   0% /run/lock
tmpfs           1.9G     0  1.9G   0% /sys/fs/cgroup
tmpfs           389M     0  389M   0% /run/user/10000
```

  * The system disk used in the example above is mounted on `/`. Your system disk will also most likely be mounted on `/`. If you are not sure, check with your IT team or appropriate system administration resource prior to proceeding.

  * You can now test this alert in one of two ways:

    * **Method 1:** (_Conservative, no test changes on server_)
      * Lowering or raising the percentage to closer match what your current system using in terms of disk capacity.
      * Waiting until the monitored ISLE host server actually exceeds the desired disk capacity percentage, triggers the alert and then tune or adjust as needed.

    * **Method 2:** (_Faster but caution ahead on using these commands, you'll be creating fake data_)
      * Lower the percentage to closer match what your current system using in terms of disk capacity.
      * Create test conditions to exceed your ISLE system disk usage and trigger the alert.
        * Change the Alert percentage to something closer to the current `Use%` displayed from the `df -h` command.
        * Try to set it within 1 percentage point or so of that above value.
        * Create a dummy `1 GB` text file on your server. Use your user home directory for this process and not in an ISLE data location.
          * Run `dd if=/dev/zero of=file1.txt count=1024 bs=1048576` to create the dummy 1 GB file
      * Check your email account for the Alert message with:
        * For example: `Disk Space Alert-host=acme-prod - acme-prod disk usage is at 76.03% - Critical` in the email message header
        * If you get your alert email, great!
        * If the alert doesn't show up, then retrace your steps, perhaps use a lower percentage of capacity and tune as necessary.
      * Change the percentage back to the higher value. Repeat as necessary on all additional servers.
      * Delete the dummy `file1.txt` file
        * Note this will trigger a followup Alert email that the server disk capacity is below the Alert level again and as such "OK."
        * For example: `Disk Space Alert-host=acme-prod - acme-prod disk usage is at 45.01% - OK`

##### Alert - Disk Space Flux code explanation

* `{{ .ID }}` = Name of the Alert
* `{{ index .Tags "host" }}` = Name of server
* `{{ .Name }}.` = Name of impacted service in this case `disk`
* `{{ index .Fields "value" | printf "%0.2f" }}%` = Reported disk used space from monitored server formatted to display properly in email
* `{{ .Level }}.` = `Critical` or `OK`

This message is slightly formatted for readability and context.

By using this starter message via email effectively you'll get two alerts for the following conditions:

* When the system (server) is passes the disk used % threshold, you'll get an alert email.
  * For example, the system name is `acme-prod` and the alert is set to `75%`: `Disk Space Alert-host=acme-prod - acme-prod disk usage is at 76.03% - Critical`
  * There may be additional information put in the email body for review. It will be formatted in JSON notation.

* Once you've taken manual steps on the affected server to increase disk capacity and the ISLE system, its containers and services are effectively backup and running, you'll get a follow-up email that indicates that the disk capacity is back below the given Alert level and thus acceptable. This alert may not always fire due to the involved steps of increasing disk size. You may see this message if using the optional test steps above.
  * For example: `Disk Space Alert-host=acme-prod - acme-prod disk usage is at 45.01% - OK`
  * There may be additional information put in the email body for review. It will be formatted in JSON notation.

Please note: The code suggestions above use Influxdata `Flux` syntax, for more information on how to change messages and their values please use the official [Flux syntax basics documentation](https://docs.influxdata.com/flux/v0.36/introduction/getting-started/syntax-basics/) for more information.

## Release Notes

Additional changes were made to the ISLE base images to allow for:

* Log levels to be set by users in the project in the respective environment's `.env` file (_staging.env or production.env_)

* Logging in ISLE is now set to `stdout` and `stderr` by default instead of log files.

  * Choice in Docker log drivers e.g. `syslog` vs `json`, etc.

  * TICK uses the Docker `syslog` log driver by default.

  * Flexibility for users using monitoring tools other than TICK
