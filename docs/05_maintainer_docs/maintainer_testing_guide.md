The ISLE project is currently testing the ISLE 1.1 Release Candidate.  We are actively soliciting volunteers to test the following scenarios:

* Installing a New ISLE Site on Ubuntu 18.04
* Installing a New ISLE Site on Centos 7.x
* Updating an exisiting ISLE site to the latest 1.1 Release Candidate
* Installing a Demo version of ISLE on Windows 10 using Docker
* Installing a Demo version of ISLE on Mac OSX High Sierra using Docker

After testing the above scenarios, the project will announce a second round of testing for migrations:

* Migrating an existing Islandora site to ISLE on Ubuntu 18.04
* Migrating an existing Islandora site to ISLE on Centos 7.x
