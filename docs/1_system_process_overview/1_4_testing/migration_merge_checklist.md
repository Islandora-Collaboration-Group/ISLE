### Migration Merge Checklist

This section is to serve as a new checklist for the editing or merging of the copied Islandora Production server(s) data and config files to the appropriate config directory on the new ISLE Host Server.

The suggested workflow is for endusers to review the Production file(s) first, make note of any settings and then make appropriate edits within `/config/enduser-renamed-directory.institution/` to change values, add passwords or usernames etc unless otherwise directed e.g. Apache `html` and Fedora `data`.

While this checklist will attempt to point out most of the merge challenges or pitfalls, ISLE assumes no responsibility or liability in this matter should an enduser have customizations beyond what this guide outlines.

**Please note:**

* In most cases, many of the configuration files (copied from `isle-prod-project.institution` to `enduser-renamed-directory.institution`) will have comments (#) in them to help guide endusers to make the appropriate edits e.g. (# enduser edit here)

* In most cases, many of the configuration files (copied from `isle-prod-project.institution` to `enduser-renamed-directory.institution`) will have fake or empty settings in them. Please remove, edit or enter new values as advised.

### Assumptions / Prerequisites
* The enduser has completed Steps 1 -4 of the [Migration Guide](migration_guide.md).
    * Includes the steps outlined within the [Migration Export Checklist](migration_export_checklist.md) to copy over production data and configuration files.

* The enduser is currently on Step 5 of the [Migration Guide](migration_guide.md)

#### Apache

Compare, edit, merge or copy the following from the suggested directory `/path_to/islandora_production_data_storage/apache/` on the ISLE Host server to either:

* `/opt/isle/config/enduser-renamed-directory-prod.institution/apache/`

* `/path_to/isle_production_data_storage/enduser-renamed-directory-dev.institution`

This data will be used in conjunction with an Apache container.

| Data          | Description                 | Production Data Copy Location on ISLE Host Server  | Merge, Copy or Edit Location / Destination            | Notes         |
| ------------- | -------------               | -------------                                      | -------------                                         | ------------- |
| html          | Islandora/Drupal Website    | /path_to/islandora_production_data_storage/apache/ | /path_to/isle_production_data_storage/enduser-renamed-directory-dev.institution/apache/ | _see below_   |
| settings.php  | Drupal settings.php file    | /path_to/islandora_production_data_storage/apache/ | /config/enduser-renamed-directory.institution/apache/ | _see below_   |
| site.conf     | Apache webserver vhost file | /path_to/islandora_production_data_storage/apache/ | /config/enduser-renamed-directory.institution/apache/ | _see below_   |

* `html` - endusers will **COPY** this entire directory **instead** to `/path_to/isle_production_data_storage/enduser-renamed-directory-dev.institution/apache/html`

* `settings.php` - endusers will want to edit database and user names for Drupal sites to connect properly.

    * Lines 251 -253: Change the appropriate settings for the Drupal website database, associate database user name and password. Do not change the `host` settings.  

    * Line 288: _Recommend adding a Drupal hash value here of 25+ alpha-numeric characters_

    * Line 312: `$base_url` should be the URL of the ISLE production Drupal website e.g. `https://site.institution.extension`

* `site.conf` - endusers will edit this file as required to setup the Apache webserver on the Apache container.

    * The filename can stay the same or can be changed. Please note that Line 85 of the associated `docker-compose.yml` will need to be updated if the file is renamed

    * Lines 2, 3, 6, 7, 34 - 37, 39, 40, 44 & 45:  endusers will edit this file as directed in the (# enduser please edit this and then remove this comment) instructions.

       * Do remove (# enduser please edit this and then remove this comment) after editing or adding the appropriate values.

#### Apache Optional Edits

| Data          | Description                 | Production Data Copy Location on ISLE Host Server  | Merge, Copy or Edit Location / Destination            | Notes         |
| ------------- | -------------               | -------------                                      | -------------                                         | ------------- |
| php.ini       | PHP configuration file      | /path_to/islandora_production_data_storage/apache/ | /config/enduser-renamed-directory.institution/apache/ | _see below_   |

* `php.ini` - endusers can make appropriate edits within `/config/enduser-renamed-directory.institution/apache/php.ini` to increase the upload settings, memory etc. as needed. Otherwise leaving the default values should work.

* **Please note:** an additional line will have to be added to the associated `docker-compose.yml` in the Apache `volumes:` section for this edit to work e.g. `- ./apache/php.ini:/etc/php.ini`

| Data          | Description                 | Production Data Copy Location on ISLE Host Server  | Merge, Copy or Edit Location / Destination            | Notes         |
| ------------- | -------------               | -------------                                      | -------------                                         | ------------- |
| tmpreaper     | Cronjob for tmpreaper       | /path_to/islandora_production_data_storage/apache/ | /config/enduser-renamed-directory.institution/apache/ | _see below_   |

* `tmpreaper` - (optional) endusers may want to edit this tmpreaper cron job for different locations and/or times. The `docker-compose.yml` file will need an associated bind-mount for this change.

* **Please note:** an additional line will have to be added to the associated `docker-compose.yml` in the Apache `volumes:` section for this edit to work e.g. `- ./apache/tmpreaper/cron:/etc/cron.d/tmpreaper-cron`


#### Fedora


Compare, edit, merge or copy the following from the suggested directory `/path_to/islandora_production_data_storage/fedora/` on the ISLE Host server to either:

* `/opt/isle/config/enduser-renamed-directory-prod.institution/fedora/`

* `/path_to/isle_production_data_storage/enduser-renamed-directory-dev.institution/fedora/`

| Data              | Description                   | Possible Location                | Suggested Destination                      | Notes         |
| -------------     | -------------                 | -------------                    | -------------                              | ------------- |
| data              | Entire Fedora data directory  | /usr/local/fedora/             | /path_to/isle_production_data_storage/enduser-renamed-directory-dev.institution/fedora/ | _see below_ |
