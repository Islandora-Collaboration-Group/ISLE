The ISLE project uses `mkdocs` a static site generator designed for building project documentation. Documentation source files are written in `Markdown`, and configured with a single `YAML` configuration file. The `mkdocs` software then creates static `HTML` pages for hosting on GitHub Pages. This software can also be used locally on an end user's personal computer for review and editing of materials.

Please note there are two key elements to the ISLE Documentation.

1. ISLE Documentation github.com Pages **(static HTML):**  
    * Used by end users for Documentation
    * Clean, crisp nicely formatted hosted ISLE Documentation with navigation.
    * [https://islandora-collaboration-group.github.io/ISLE/](https://islandora-collaboration-group.github.io/ISLE/)


2. ISLE Documentation github.com Repository **(Markdown files):**  
    * Used by ISLE Committers to create and manage ISLE Documentation
    * `Markdown` files (`.md`) stored in an online git repository that when rendered by the `mkdocs` software produce the above mentioned nicely formatted static HTML pages.

_Please refer to the **Documentation** section of the [Glossary](../appendices/glossary.md) if terms used are not clear._


A very handy primer for writing documentation using `MkDocs` has been written here: [http://www.mkdocs.org/user-guide/writing-your-docs/](http://www.mkdocs.org/user-guide/writing-your-docs/)
