## Note about Red Hat

At this time, Red Hat Enterprise Server 7 has been tested but there is a distinct lack of clarity as to what version of Docker is running and/or is supported.

Unless a license for Docker Enterprise Edition (Docker EE) is purchased, the ISLE Maintainers do not recommend using Red Hat at this time due to unanticipated cost.

Currently ISLE has only been built, tested and supported using the free edition of Docker Community Edition (`docker-ce`).

   * **Challenge 1:** _Docker Community Edition not clearly supported on or by Red Hat_
     * [https://docs.docker.com/install/](https://docs.docker.com/install/) (see matrix)
     * [https://www.docker.com/community-edition](https://www.docker.com/community-edition)

   * **Challenge 2:** _Red Hat seems to direct endusers to pay for Docker EE license instead of using Docker Community Edition_
     * [https://www.docker.com/enterprise-edition](https://www.docker.com/enterprise-edition)

   * **Challenge 3:** _Choices for alternate free Docker versions supported by Red Hat are not clear in features comparison or support roadmap._
