As a result of the ISLE Phase II Sprint F - Optimize Docker Images in Fall 2019, the ISLE repository has had several changes:

* Original ISLE git repo size was ~182 MB and would take a minimum of 10 -15 seconds or more to clone (_depending on one's Internet connection_)

- The cleaned up ISLE git repo size is now 6.6 MB and should take a minimum of less than 3 seconds to clone (_depending on one's Internet connection_)

* a new clean up script called [isle-v140-git-cleanup-script.sh](../assets/isle-v140-git-cleanup-script.sh) has been added along with this documentation created for endusers to run on their ISLE repository.

- Any new pull request will have to be created from a forked or cloned ISLE repository that has had this cleanup process performed on it.

## **AS OF THE ISLE v.1.4.0 release in November 2019 (MANDATORY)**

Due to removal of older files and folders and git changes in the ISLE git repository as of `November 25, 2019`, please review the following:

* If you are a **new** ISLE user and are cloning or forking this project for the first time after `November 25, 2019`, then you can **ignore this documentation** and move on to the Quick Start section within the README.md as needed.

- If you have **previously forked or cloned** the ISLE project **prior to** `November 25, 2019`, then you **do need to follow the instructions** given in this documentation.

* If you still feel like you're not sure or cannot tell if you need to do this, then please refer to the instructions given in the `Identification Tools` section below within this documentation.

- If you intend to submit pull requests (PRs) of any kind (documentation, code etc) to the ISLE project, ISLE maintainers will **NOT** accept PRs from repos that haven't had the script run on them as using an uncleaned forked repo will cause the removed files to return.

There is a brief description of what the script actually does found below in the **Script commands - explained** section.

## Git cleanup process


### Git cleanup process - Overview

The steps below in the section `Git cleanup process` will have you perform the following:

* Open up a terminal and perform steps as directed
- Make a directory called `ISLE_140_GIT_CLEANUP` on your laptop or workstation to perform all of these steps and collect all materials
* Download the git cleanup script (`isle-v140-git-cleanup-script.sh`)and move it to the `ISLE_140_GIT_CLEANUP` directory
- `git clone --mirror` your forked or cloned ISLE project directory to the `ISLE_140_GIT_CLEANUP` directory
* Run the git cleanup script. It will prompt you to only enter the name of your forked or cloned ISLE project directory.
- `git push` back the changes to your remote forked or cloned ISLE project directory.
* Clone down your newly changed and smaller forked or cloned ISLE project directory again to ensure that the repositiory is smaller to a location of your choice.
- Remove all previous larger size versions of your forked or cloned ISLE project directory. You can now delete the `ISLE_140_GIT_CLEANUP` directory and its contents.
* Work from the newly resized and smaller forked or cloned ISLE project directory.
  
### Git cleanup process - Steps

* Open up a terminal

* Change directory to a location of your choice
  * `cd your_path_here`

* Make a new temporary direcotory called `ISLE_140_GIT_CLEANUP`
  * `mkdir ISLE_140_GIT_CLEANUP`

* Download the script found and save it to the `ISLE_140_GIT_CLEANUP` directory and fix the permissions.
  * `wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Islandora-Collaboration-Group/ISLE/master/docs/assets/isle-v140-git-cleanup-script.sh`
  * `chmod 755 isle-v140-git-cleanup-script.sh`

* Run this git command to clone your forked or cloned ISLE project directory. This is not the usual `git clone` command, note the `--mirror` flag.
  * `git clone --mirror git project url`
  * Example:
    * `git clone --mirror git@github.com:username/ISLE.git` (_as a fork using the same project name or title_)
    * `git clone --mirror git@github.com:username/yourprojectnamehere-isle.git` (_as a fork or cloned repo using a different project name or title_)
  * This will create a new directory called `ISLE.git` or `yourprojectnamehere-isle.git` which is not typical clone or fork output.

* Run the cleanup script
  * `./isle-v140-git-cleanup-script.sh`

* At the start of the script, there will be an interactive input prompt asking you to:
  
```bash
"Type in the name of your git repo only e.g. ISLE (do not include .git) and then press the [ENTER] or [RETURN] key to continue"`
Enter the name here:  
```
* Enter the name of your forked or cloned ISLE git repository without the .git extension e.g `ISLE` or `yourprojectnamehere-isle` etc.

* The script will continue and the process takes about 30 - 45 seconds depending on the speed of your system with minimal output.

* Your final step is to push this local smaller repo back to the remote repository
* `git push origin master`

* Clone down your newly changed and smaller forked or cloned ISLE project directory again to ensure that the repositiory is smaller to a location of your choice.

- Remove all previous larger size versions of your forked or cloned ISLE project directory. You can now delete the `ISLE_140_GIT_CLEANUP` directory and its contents.

* Work from the newly resized and smaller forked or cloned ISLE project directory.

## Identification tools

* **Please note:** In some of the examples given below, the title and/or names of the git repository examples use ISLE; your forked or cloned repo may be using a different project name or title, so please replace the `ISLE` for the name of your forked or cloned ISLE project git repository instead e.g. `yourprojectnamehere-isle`.

If you would like to check if the files have been removed or are still present:

* Clone this [repo](https://github.com/ivantikal/git-tools.git) to pinpoint offending files and folders to the parent directory of where your local forked or cloned ISLE git repository is located. **Do not** clone this tool **into** your local forked or cloned ISLE git repository.
  * `git clone https://github.com/ivantikal/git-tools.git`
  * Your parent directory should now look like this example below: (_again please note your local forked or cloned ISLE git repository might not use the ISLE as the title_)

```bash
  directory/
  ├── git-tools
  └── ISLE
```

* Run the tools against your existing local forked or cloned ISLE git repository.
  * **Example** usage for finding the 50 biggest files or folders in your local forked or cloned ISLE git repository. You can swap out the `ISLE` for the name of your forked or cloned ISLE project git repository e.g. `yourprojectnamehere-isle`
    * `./git-tools/clean-binaries/get_biggest_files_in_history.sh -r ./ISLE/ -n 50`

* Review the resulting file to see if any of the files and folders listed in the `Files & Folder removed` section appear.
  * `cat ./git-tools/clean-binaries/get_biggest_files_in_history.sh.tmp/bigtosmall.txt`

* If none of the files appear, you don't need to run the script.

* If **any** of the files or folders appear, you **have** to run the script. Scroll back up to the top of this document and follow the steps as provided.

* More information can be found here on to use this [tool](https://www.tikalk.com/posts/2017/04/19/delete-binaries-from-git-repository/)

## Script commands - explained

You are welcome to open up the `isle-v140-git-cleanup-script.sh` in a text editor to review its contents prior to running.

Essentially `isle-v140-git-cleanup-script.sh` will perform the following:

* Download the [BFG-repo-cleaner](https://rtyley.github.io/bfg-repo-cleaner/) jar file `bfg-1.113.0.jar`

* Run the appropriate BFG java commands to delete files and folders

* Run these git commands on your forked or cloned ISLE git repo
  * `git reflog expire --expire=now --all && git gc --prune=now --aggressive`

* **Please note:** This script will **not** push back to your source repo. That you need to do manually.
