## Browser Caching and the Warning: "Bad Gateway"
* Problem: While attempting to access "https://yourprojectnamehere.localdomain/" you see the browser result: "Bad Gateway"
* Possible Solution: Open "https://yourprojectnamehere.localdomain/" in an Incognito window (that prevents the browser from using prior cached pages). (Alternately, you can empty your browser cache in your regular browser.)

---

## Fatal: Could Not Read From Remote Repository
If you encounter an error like this:

* Set up an SSH key and add it to your local ssh-agent to add access rights to read from your remote repository.
* This will allow you to pull from your git repository hosting service. 
* See SSH key "How To" instructions on [Github](https://help.github.com/en/articles/generating-a-new-ssh-key-and-adding-it-to-the-ssh-agent) or [Bitbucket](https://confluence.atlassian.com/bitbucket/set-up-an-ssh-key-728138079.html) or [Gitlab](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/ssh/).

## Fedora Hash Size (Conditional)

**Are you migrating an existing Islandora site that has greater than one million objects?**

This is a power user setting and is an incredibly rare situation, so do this step only if you have an akubra level 2 or greater.

While this will depend on your pre-existing Production system, it is important to double-check this. If you have a larger hash size than the default ISLE system (##), and don't follow the settings below, ISLE may not function properly when your data has been migrated. (Note: even though it looks like a placeholder, the actual syntax value is actually `##`.)

*  If you have larger Fedora collections, there is a possibility that you made changes to the `akubra-llstore.xml` file to allow for the creation of larger or deeper hash directories)
* You will need to copy your `/usr/local/fedora/server/config/spring/akubra-llstore.xml` from your Production Fedora System to `./config/fedora/akubra-llstore.xml`
* You will then need to add an extra line in the Fedora service (fedora) volumes section to bind mount this file in. This will guarantee proper Fedora data hash structure.
    * `- ./config/fedora/akubra-llstore.xml:/usr/local/fedora/server/config/spring/akubra-llstore.xml`

## How to Use a MySQL GUI Client to Import Drupal Database

* If you want to use a MySQL client with a GUI to import the Production MySQL Drupal database you'll need to uncomment the `ports` section of the MySQL service within the `docker-compose.local.yml` to make it so you can access port `3306` from the host computer. If you are already running MySQL on your personal computer, you'll have a port conflict and will need to either shutdown that service prior to running ISLE or change `3306:3306` to something like `9306:3306`. Please double-check.

## Non-Running Docker Containers

If you don't see all containers running, then stop the running containers with `docker-compose down` and start the containers one at a time following the instructions below:

*  MySQL image pull & container launch

    `docker pull islandoracollabgroup/isle-mysql:1.2.0`

    `docker-compose up -d mysql`

*  Fedora image pull & container launch

    `docker pull islandoracollabgroup/isle-fedora:1.2.0`

    `docker-compose up -d fedora`

    (Optional but recommended troubleshooting step)

    * Please note the Tomcat service requires about  one to three minutes to startup and as such if the end user rushes to the URL supplied below, the service page may time out or be reported as unreachable. Give it a little time.
    * After spinning up fedora container, check if the Fedora service is running prior to advancing.
    * Navigate to http://hostip:8081/manager/html a popup login prompt should appear.
    * Enter the user name of `admin` and the password of `isle_admin`
    * Upon login a large display of running Tomcat applications should display, scroll down to fedora
    * The application state / status should be true
    * If false appears instead, attempt to restart the Fedora service manually.
    * Select the restart button to the right of the status area.
    * If it still fails, review the mounted Fedora logs. The docker-compose.yml file will indicate where the logs are located.
    * Using terminal and then entering a command like `tail -n 300 - <path to ISLE project/data/fedora/log/tomcat:/usr/local/tomcat/logs/fedora.log` should display enough information to troubleshoot or restart the entire startup process.

* Solr image pull & container launch

    `docker pull islandoracollabgroup/isle-solr:1.2.0`

    `docker-compose up -d solr`

* Apache image pull & container launch

    `docker pull islandoracollabgroup/isle-apache:1.2.0`

    `docker-compose up -d apache`

---

## Port Conflicts
If you encounter an error like this:

`Error starting userland proxy: Bind for 0.0.0.0:xxxx failed: port is already allocated`

then ISLE may have encountered a conflict with the `xxxx` port identified in the error message.

In MacOS, this can frequently be caused by a local Apache or Nginx web server, or local MySQL server.  

You may need to remove or disable these local web servers before you can successfully install ISLE. (Please first ensure it's not being used.)

* If you have a local Apache web server that ships with most MacOS machines may conflict with port 80, and can usually be disabled from a terminal using these commands:

    * `sudo apachectl stop`
    * `sudo launchctl unload -w /System/Library/LaunchDaemons/org.apache.httpd.plist 2>/dev/null`

* If you have a local `Nginx` web server it may conflict with port 8080, and it can usually be disabled from a terminal using:

    * `sudo nginx -s stop`

Once your web server(s) have been disabled, resume the ISLE install process by repeating your last installation command, presumably `docker-compose up -d`.

## Viewing Logs in ISLE 1.2.0 or Higher

As of ISLE release logging to physical file has been turned off, stdout & stderr are to console only no more physical files. This means if you need to view logs for debugging, here are some methods:

* [Docker method:](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/logs/) (_when using the Docker json driver and TICK is not on_)
  * Single container: `docker logs -f <containername>`
  * All containers: `docker logs --tail=0 --follow`

* [Docker-compose method:(https://docs.docker.com/compose/reference/logs/)] (when using the Docker json driver and TICK is not on)
Single container: docker-compose logs -f  <containername>
All containers: docker-compose logs --tail=0 --follow

* Use the [TICK Log viewer](../optional-components/tickstack.md) if TICK is setup and using the Docker syslog driver (Production / Staging only)
