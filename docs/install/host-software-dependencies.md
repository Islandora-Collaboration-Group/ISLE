## Ubuntu

### Step 1: Install Server Prerequisites and Git

- Open a terminal on your personal computer and ssh to the server or VM.

- You must have `root` level permissions.
    - If you are not already `root`, enter either `sudo -s` or `sudo su` to become root.

- Update and install the following required software:
    - `apt-get update && upgrade`
    - `apt-get install -y openssl git htop ntp wget curl nano apt-transport-https ca-certificates software-properties-common`

### Step 2: Install Docker

- Add the Docker Repository.
```
curl -fsSL https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu/gpg | sudo apt-key add -
```

```
add-apt-repository "deb [arch=amd64] https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu $(lsb_release -cs) stable"
```
- Update package list.
    - `apt-get update`
- Install Docker.
    - `apt-get install -y docker-ce`

- Enable and start Docker.
    - `systemctl enable docker && systemctl start docker`

### Step 3: Install Docker-Compose

- Copy and paste the command below.
<!--- Why do we hardcode this version of docker-compose? Is there a way to get the latest stable release instead? Or do we create a list of software versions to update periodically? Note: This occurs 2 times in this file. --->
```
curl -L https://github.com/docker/compose/releases/download/1.23.1/docker-compose-`uname -s`-`uname -m` -o /usr/local/bin/docker-compose && chmod +x /usr/local/bin/docker-compose
```

- Test the Installation.
    - `docker-compose --version`

- **Example output:** `docker-compose version 1.23.1, build 1110ad01`

### Step 4: Add Your User to the `docker` Group
Allow your user to run Docker commands and to launch the entire ISLE stack.

- If you are still `root` (`whoami`), type `exit` to become your normal user.

- Add yourself to the `docker` group.
    - `sudo usermod -aG docker $USER`

- Type `exit` and then reconnect (this allows your effective groups to update).


Your host server is now configured and ready to install ISLE.

## Mac

### Step 1: Install Git
Git must be installed to get a copy (called a `clone`) of the current ISLE project. (Git is a software version control system for tracking changes in computer files and coordinating work on those files among multiple people.)

* Open a `terminal` (launch Spotlight, type "Terminal," double-click result "Terminal")

* Enter: `git --version`

* If git is already installed, the above command will output the installed version number.
    * **Example:** "git version 2.15.1"

* If git is not installed, the above command may trigger the "Install Command Line Developer Tools" prompt to appear. If so:
    * Click on the blue `Install` button for the license agreement.
    * Click the white `Agree` button.
    * The package will take 1-2 minutes to download.
    * Click the `Done` button.

* If git is not installed and there is no prompt to "Install Command Line Developer Tools", then use this tutorial to [Install Git on Mac OS X](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/install-git).

* Enter the following to fix a potential issue with long filenames:
    * `git config --system core.longpaths true`

### Step 2: Install Docker for Mac

* Click [Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop) and follow these instructions to download and install:
    * Click the button: `Download Desktop for Mac`
    * Click the button: `Please Login to Download`
        * Click: `Sign In` or `Sign Up`
    * Click the button: `Download Docker Desktop`
        * The `Docker.dmg` file should start to download. Check your `Downloads` directory.
    * Double-click the `Docker.dmg` file. The file should open and mount in a new window or prompt.
    * As instructed within the prompt, drag and drop the whale icon to the right towards the `Applications` directory shortcut, a tiny green plus sign should appear, now let go from the mouse.
    * The application should start to copy data to the `Applications` directory, this process may take 1-5 minutes depending on the speed of your hard-drive.
* Important Docker installation notes:
    * If Docker prompts you to restart the personal computer, please do so.
    * If Docker prompts you to install additional Docker updates, please do so.
    * If Docker prompts you (with a popup dialogue) to `Login with your Docker ID`, you may do so with your Docker.com account information, or you may skip it and close the window as Docker is already running; you do not need to login to use it.
    * If Docker prompts you for access to your computer's filesystem, please do so, then close the dialogue window.
* When the installation is finished:
    * Launch the "Docker Desktop" application from the `Applications` directory
    * This process should may take 2-5 minutes depending on the speed of your hard-drive.
* When "Docker Desktop" is fully started, a whale icon will appear at top of the screen.  Clicking on this icon should show the message: "Docker Desktop is running".

### Step 3: Install Docker-Compose

- The Docker installation has installed the newest version of `docker-compose`.


Your host server is now configured and ready to install ISLE.

## Windows

### Step 1: Install "Git for Windows"

"Git for Windows" will install both "Git" and "Git Bash". Git must be installed so you may get a copy (called a "clone") of the current ISLE project. Git is a software version control system for tracking changes in computer files and coordinating work on those files among multiple people. Git Bash is a useful command line interface that behaves similarly to LINUX and UNIX environments; you will use this to enter commands provided below.

* Let's begin by checking to see if you have "Git Bash" already installed.
    * Press the Windows key.
    * Type `Git Bash`
* Is "Git Bash" installed?
    * If you see "Git Bash" listed, then it is installed. 
    * If "Git Bash" is not installed, please install "Git for Windows" now:
        * Download: [Git for Windows](https://gitforwindows.org/)
        * Click `Download`; `Save` this file to your Desktop; `double-click` that file to install; then click `Yes` to the prompt.
        * Click `Next` and accept ALL of the installer's default selections, with one exception:
            * **Choosing the default editor used by Git: Which editor would you like Git to use?**
            * Select your preferred text editor (we recommend "Atom").
            * If you select "Atom" and do not yet have it installed, the installer expects you to use the provided [Atom](https://atom.io/) link to download and install Atom. When that is completed, return to the `Git for Windows` installer, click `Next` and complete that installation. (If `Next` is greyed out, click `Back` then `Next` to continue...)
* Press the Windows key
* Type `Git Bash`
* RIGHT-CLICK the "Git Bash" app to open it; select `Run as administrator`; then click `Yes` to the prompt.
* In the Git Bash terminal:
    * Enter: `git --version`
    * The above command will output the installed version number. This confirms that git is properly installed.
    * **Example:** "git version 2.23.0.windows.1"
* Check for updates:
    * Enter: `git update-git-for-windows`
* Enter the following to fix a potential issue with long filenames:
    * `git config --system core.longpaths true`

### Step 2: Install "Docker Desktop for Windows"

**Important: Docker requires Windows Professional or Windows Enterprise**

* Click [Docker Desktop for Windows](https://store.docker.com/editions/community/docker-ce-desktop-windows) and follow these instructions to download and install:
    * Click the button: `Please Login to Download`
        * Click: `Sign In` or `Sign Up`
    * Click the button: `Download Docker Desktop` (or `Get Docker`)
        * `Save` this file to your Desktop; `double-click` that file to install; then click `Yes` to the prompt.
    * Click `OK` or `Next` and accept ALL of the installer's default selections.
* Important Docker installation notes:
    * If Docker prompts you to restart the personal computer, please do so.
    * If Docker prompts you to install additional Docker updates, please do so.
    * If Docker prompts you to enable `Hyper-V and Containers features`, click `OK`.
    * If Docker prompts you (with a popup dialogue) to `Login with your Docker ID`, you may do so with your Docker.com account information, or you may skip it and close the window as Docker is already running; you do not need to login to use it.
* When the installation is finished:
    * Press the Windows key
    * Type `Docker Desktop`
    * Click the "Docker Desktop" app to open it
* When "Docker Desktop" is fully started, a whale icon will appear in the Windows "Notification Area". Hovering over this icon should show the message: "Docker Desktop is running".

* Enable Docker Shared Drives
    * Right-click on the Docker whale icon
    * Select "Settings"
    * Select "Shared Drives"
    * Check the box for your local "C" drive
    * Click "Apply"
    * If Docker prompts you for access to your computer's filesystem, please do so, then close the dialogue window.
