The following files have new Varnish and Blazegraph information and ENVs which may need you to review, edit and/or merge in previous settings:

    * There are in-line instructions on how to switch between the default mulgara and optional component blazegraph

* All `docker-compose.*.yml` files have a new optional Blazegraph service section, (_commented out_) along with a (_commented out_) Blazegraph volume definition
    * **Test** - `test.env` by default now tests Blazegraph instead of mulgara.
