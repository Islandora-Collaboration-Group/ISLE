AB  - BACKGROUND: We report our technique for robotic-assisted laparoscopic cystoprostatectomy (RARCP) and extracorporeal urinary diversion and clinical outcomes. METHODS: Between October 2003 and December 2008 we 58 RARCPs with extracorporeal continent urinary diversion. Preoperative, operative and postoperative data was evaluated. RESULTS: Mean patient (range 46-89) years, with an average American Society of classification of 2.9. Mean operative time was 8 (range 5-11) h. Median loss was 450 ml. Thirteen patients received intra-operative blood and 22 patients received peri-operative blood transfusions. Continent diversions were performed by means of the Studer technique (n = 42) or pouch (n = 16). Mean number of lymph nodes examined on lymphadenectomy (range 0-52). CONCLUSIONS: Our RARCP and continent diversion technique and feasible option for primary urothelial carcinoma of the bladder. and surgical outcomes are comparable to open cystectomy series.

AB  - Genetic background affects susceptibility to ileocolitis in mice deficient in two intracellular glutathione peroxidases, GPx1 and GPx2. The C57BL/6 (B6) GPx1/2 double-knockout (DKO) mice have mild ileocolitis, and 129S1/Sv (129) DKO mice have severe inflammation. We used diet to modulate ileocolitis; a casein-based defined diet with AIN76A micronutrients (AIN) attenuates inflammation compared to conventional LabDiets. Because luminal microbiota induce DKO ileocolitis, we assessed bacterial composition with automated ribosomal intergenic-spacer analysis (ARISA) on cecal DNA. We found that mouse strain had the strongest impact on the composition of microbiota than diet and GPx genotypes. In comparing AIN and LabDiet, DKO mice were more resistant to change than the non-DKO or WT mice. However, supplementing yeast and inulin to AIN diet greatly altered microflora profiles in the DKO mice. From 129 DKO strictly, we found overgrowth of Escherichia coli. We conclude that genetic background predisposes mice to colonization of potentially pathogenic E. coli.

AB  - PURPOSE: Patients with early-stage, resectable, non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) are at risk for recurrent disease, and 5-year survival rates do not exceed 75%. Angiogenesis inhibitors have shown clinical activity in patients with late-stage NSCLC, raising the possibility that targeting the vascular endothelial growth factor pathway in earlier-stage disease may be beneficial. This proof-of-concept study examined safety and efficacy of short-term, preoperative pazopanib monotherapy in patients with operable stage I/II NSCLC. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Patients scheduled for resection received oral pazopanib 800 mg/d for 2 to 6 weeks preoperatively. Tumor response was measured by high-resolution computed tomography, permitting estimation of change in tumor volume and diameter. Gene-expression profiling was performed on 77 pre- and post-treatment lung samples from 34 patients. RESULTS: Of 35 patients enrolled, 33 (94%) had clinical stage I NSCLC and two (6%) had clinical stage II NSCLC. Median treatment duration was 16 days (range, 3 to 29 days). Thirty patients (86%) achieved tumor-volume reduction after pazopanib treatment. Two patients achieved tumor-volume reduction > or = 50%, and three patients had partial response according to Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors. Pazopanib was generally well tolerated. The most common adverse events included grade 2 hypertension, diarrhea, and fatigue. One patient developed pulmonary embolism 11 days after surgery. Several pazopanib target genes and other angiogenic factors were dysregulated post-treatment. CONCLUSION: Short-duration pazopanib was generally well tolerated and demonstrated single-agent activity in patients with early-stage NSCLC. Several target genes were dysregulated after pazopanib treatment, validating target-specific response and indicating a persistent pazopanib effect on lung cancer tissue. Further clinical evaluation of pazopanib in NSCLC is planned.

AB  - Use of PET is widespread and increasing in the United States, mainly for oncologic applications. In November 2006, the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) gathered a panel of experts to review the literature and develop clinical recommendations for using PET scans in lymphoma and non-small cell lung, breast, and colorectal cancers. However, because its use is not restricted to these diseases, and evidence is accumulating for its application in other types of cancers, NCCN convened a second meeting in December 2008 to expand on the initial report. A multidisciplinary panel met to discuss the current data on PET application for various tumor types, including genitourinary, gynecologic, pancreatic, hepatobiliary, thyroid, brain, small cell lung, gastric, and esophageal cancers, and sarcoma and myeloma. This report summarizes the proceedings of this meeting, including discussions of the background of PET, the role of PET in oncology, principles of PET use, emerging applications, and possible future developments.

AB  - This is the first report describing the use of robotic technology for the treatment of chylothorax. We present a 22-year-old with mixed embryonal cell and seminoma germ cell cancer refractory to medical and surgical treatment. The patient had rising markers and a growing left lower lung lobe metastasis. After left lower lobectomy, left-sided chylothorax developed. Conservative management failed, and a robotic right-sided thoracic duct ligation was performed. Other treatment options are reviewed.

AB  - The inheritance pattern of a number of major genetic disorders suggests the possible involvement of genes that are expressed from one allele and silent on the other, but such genes are difficult to detect. Since DNA methylation in regulatory regions is often a mark of gene silencing, we modified existing microarray-based assays to detect both methylated and unmethylated DNA sequences in the same sample, a variation we term the MAUD assay. We probed a 65 Mb region of mouse Chr 7 for gene-associated sequences that show two distinct DNA methylation patterns in the mouse CNS. Selected genes were then tested for allele-specific expression in clonal neural stem cell lines derived from reciprocal F(1) (C57BL/6xJF1) hybrid mice. In addition, using a separate approach, we directly analyzed allele-specific expression of a group of genes interspersed within clusters of OlfR genes, since the latter are subject to allelic exclusion. Altogether, of the 500 known genes in the chromosomal region surveyed, five show monoallelic expression, four identified by the MAUD assay (Agc1, p (pink-eyed dilution), P4ha3 and Thrsp), and one by its proximity to OlfR genes (Trim12). Thrsp (thyroid hormone responsive SPOT14 homolog) is expressed in hippocampus, but the human protein homolog, S14, has also been implicated in aggressive breast cancer. Monoallelic expression of the five genes is not coordinated at a chromosome-wide level, but rather regulated at individual loci. Taken together, our results suggest that at least 1% of previously untested genes are subject to allelic exclusion, and demonstrate a dual approach to expedite their identification.

AB  - The use of positron emission tomography (PET) is increasing rapidly in the United States, with the most common use of PET scanning related to oncology. It is especially useful in the staging and management of lymphoma, lung cancer, and colorectal cancer, according to a panel of expert radiologists, surgeons, radiation oncologists, nuclear medicine physicians, medical oncologists, and general internists convened in November 2006 by the National Comprehensive Cancer Network. The Task Force was charged with reviewing existing data and developing clinical recommendations for the use of PET scans in the evaluation and management of breast cancer, colon cancer, non-small cell lung cancer, and lymphoma. This report summarizes the proceedings of this meeting, including discussions of the background of PET, possible future developments, and the role of PET in oncology.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: There have been few reports of the use of robotic surgery to resect lung malignancies. Feasibility and safety of robotic lung resection for malignant lung lesions will be assessed by performing a retrospective analysis. METHODS: Between September 2004 and November 2006, 21 patients (11 male and 10 female patients) underwent robotic lung resection. Twenty resections were performed for primary nonsmall cell lung cancer and two for metastatic lesions. One patient had bilateral resections for two primary tumors. Fourteen lobectomies, five segementectomies, one wedge resection, and two bilobectomies were performed. Seventy-two percent of operative procedures included mediastinoscopy and/or bronchoscopy at the time of resection. RESULTS: Thirty-day mortality and conversion rate was 0%. The median operating room time and estimated blood loss was 3.6 hours and 100 mL, respectively. The median intensive care unit and total length of hospital stays were 2 and 4 days, respectively. Chest tubes were removed after a median of 2.0 days. The complication rate was 27%, which included atrial fibrillation, need for postoperative bronchoscopy, and pneumonia. The median tumor size and number of lymph nodes harvested was 2.3 cm and 16, respectively. All resection margins were negative. Median follow-up time was 9.8 months, with no local recurrences at this time. CONCLUSION: Robotic lung resection appears safe and feasible and allows for significant lymph node retrieval, offers short hospital stays and low morbidity for patients undergoing surgical resection of lung malignancies. Future studies are needed to define the role of robotic surgery in lung cancer treatment. © 2007 Lippincott Williams & Wilkins, Inc.
